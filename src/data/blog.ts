      {
        body: "Alert fatigue is the biggest silent killer of SOC effectiveness. When you're staring at a queue of a few hundred alerts, having a consistent, repeatable triage checklist is what separates a fast, accurate analyst from one who burns out chasing false positives.",
      },
      {
        heading: "1. Confirm the source before you trust the signal",
        body: "Before doing anything else, I check where the alert originated — firewall, EDR, IDS/IPS, or authentication logs — and whether that source has a history of noisy false positives for this rule. A rule that's 90% false positive on a specific host group changes how much weight I give the alert.",
      },
      {
        heading: "2. Establish a timeline",
        body: "I pull the raw event and look five minutes before and after it in the same log source. Isolated one-off events are usually less urgent than a cluster of related events building toward a pattern — like repeated auth failures followed by a success.",
      },
      {
        heading: "3. Map it to MITRE ATT&CK immediately",
        body: "Even a rough tactic/technique mapping (e.g., T1110 for brute force) gives the alert context that a raw description doesn't. It also makes escalation notes far more useful to whoever picks up the case next.",
      },
      {
        heading: "4. Check for lateral movement indicators",
        body: "If the source host has touched anything unusual — new outbound connections, unexpected admin tool usage, or logons to hosts it's never talked to — that changes severity fast, regardless of what the original alert said.",
      },
      {
        heading: "5. Document as you go, not after",
        body: "I write my evidence and reasoning into the case notes while I'm investigating, not after I've made a decision. It keeps me honest about what actually drove the verdict, and it means a senior analyst reviewing the escalation isn't reverse-engineering my thought process.",
      },
      {
        body: "None of this is groundbreaking — but consistency is what makes triage fast under pressure. The checklist doesn't slow me down; it's what lets me move quickly without second-guessing every close.",

      {
        body: "I monitor alerts across both Splunk and QRadar in my current role, and analysts new to SOC work often ask which one is 'better.' The honest answer: it depends what you're optimizing for, and most SOCs end up running more than one tool anyway.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Search flexibility",
        body: "Splunk's SPL is, in my experience, more flexible for ad-hoc investigation — chaining searches, building quick lookups, and pivoting across indexes feels natural once you're fluent in it. QRadar's AQL is capable but the query experience is more rigid, and I lean on saved searches and existing rules more than free-form querying.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Out-of-the-box correlation",
        body: "QRadar's built-in offense correlation and asset model save a lot of setup time — offenses arrive already grouped by asset, which cuts down on manually stitching related events together. Splunk gives you more control, but that control means someone has to build and tune the correlation searches first.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Alert volume and tuning",
        body: "Both tools are only as good as their tuning. I've seen a poorly tuned QRadar instance generate just as much noise as a poorly tuned Splunk deployment. The tool doesn't fix alert fatigue — the ruleset and the whitelisting discipline do.",
      },
      {
        heading: "What I'd tell a new SOC analyst",
        body: "Don't try to learn 'SIEM' in the abstract — learn to ask good questions of whichever tool is in front of you: what happened, when, on what asset, and what happened right before and after. The query language is a means to that end, not the skill itself.",

        heading: "Map the tactic first, the technique second",
        body: "Under time pressure, I map the tactic (Initial Access, Persistence, Lateral Movement, etc.) first — it's almost always obvious from the alert type. The specific technique or sub-technique can be refined later or by whoever picks up the escalation, without blocking the initial triage.",

        heading: "Keep a personal cheat sheet",
        body: "I keep a short reference of the technique IDs that show up repeatedly in our environment — T1110 (brute force), T1566 (phishing), T1078 (valid accounts) — so I'm not searching the ATT&CK site mid-investigation. It's a five-minute setup that pays for itself in the first week.",

        heading: "Use it to spot patterns across alerts, not just label one",
        body: "The real value shows up when you look across a week of tagged alerts and notice the same technique recurring against the same asset group. That's usually a stronger signal than any single alert — and it's the kind of insight that's hard to see without consistent tagging.",
      },
      {
